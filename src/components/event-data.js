        description: `
        Our Fiery Bird Showcase Sessions Online continue (behind closed doors) on Wednesday 18th August starting at 7.30pm featuring Damian Clarke & StEm, live on YouTube.
        
        Damian Clarke’s  musical mission is to showcase the Dulcimer and Hurdy Gurdy, and to make them appeal to a wider audience than the folk scene, especially for younger ears. This can also be seen in his artwork . He likes to challenge pre-conceptions in music and art, to illustrate new thoughts, to encourage and inspire.
        
        StEm is an up and coming acoustic music duo. They  write and perform melodic songs, with guitars, keys and vocals, which they hope you’ll like as much as they do.

        There are few musicians who can really be said to defy genre. Tom Gamble is such a musician. With a virtuosic technique and hugely diverse musical output, he is widely regarded as being one of the UK's most exciting young guitar soloists. Tom has released three solo albums, each to their own critical acclaim, and has been featured numerous times on BBC Radio 3.  As a live performer, Tom is known not only for his genre-bending shows, but also for his friendly spoken introductions to the music.
        
        Tara and Jaen are based in Bracknell. Tara often performs poetry and Jaen plays percussion and sings. They are both well known for running the bar at The Couch. They will be performing The Leacanabuile Cattle Raid in full for only the second time. A tale of Love, Life and Loss set on the West Coast of pre-christian Ireland. The story is accompanied by a haunting backing track composed by Neil Sadler.

        title: `Fiery Bird Showcase Sessions Online – One Formation + Jess Tuthill`,
        description: `Our Fiery Bird Showcase Sessions Online continue (behind closed doors) on Sunday 8th August starting at 4.00pm featuring One Formation and Jess Tuthill, live on YouTube.

        One Formation is the musical project of Windsor born artist Matthew Fleming. Matt spent his youth playing in rock bands and went on to study Commercial music at the University of Westminster. It was at university that Matt became inspired by a diverse range of Musical styles. Frustrated with the normality of creating a new alias when trying out a different genre, in 2011 One Formation was formed, a canvas to create all under one roof. In 2016 Matt released his self-titled debut album combining a range of acoustic styles, post rock, indie and ambient electronica. Since then One Formation has been performing live using loopers and electronics to reform the album tracks sometimes turning into new compositions such as in his ambient electronic dub set. 
        Jess Tuthill is a popular Berkshire based singer and songwriter who performs original songs on ukulele.
